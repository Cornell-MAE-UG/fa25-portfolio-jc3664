After designing the beam, I was tasked with determining its maximum deflection and selecting an appropriate beam design. First, I calculated the shear and moment equations for the different sections of the beam. Since the beam is continuous, the maximum deflection occurs at the midpoint, located at 10 cm from the end. Using the deflection equation, I calculated the required values of modulus of elasticity and moment of inertia. By selecting steel as the material, I was then able to choose a cross-section with a moment of inertia greater than the calculated value. 

As a result, I determined that the maximum deflection occurs at x = 10 cm and chose steel as the material and W310x143 for the cross-section.
